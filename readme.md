# Child theme

This is a sample child theme created mainly for [WebMan Design WordPress themes](https://www.webmandesign.eu/).


## Download

You can download the [installable theme ZIP package](https://github.com/webmandesign/child-theme/raw/master/child-theme.zip), the `child-theme.zip` file directly from [this repository](https://github.com/webmandesign/child-theme/).  
***Read the instructions below for how to set the theme up before installing!***


## How to set and use your child theme?

1. Unzip the `child-theme.zip` file on your computer.
2. Rename the `child-theme` folder to your needs.  
  **Example:** rename the folder to `my-website-theme`
4. Open the [`style.css`](https://github.com/webmandesign/child-theme/blob/master/child-theme/style.css) file and change the following:  
    * `CHILD_THEME_NAME` - change this to your desired child theme name.  
      **Example:** rename to `My Website Theme`
    * `PARENT_THEME_SLUG` - change this to the desired parent theme folder name.  
      **Example:** if you are using **Reykjavik** WordPress theme as parent, set this to `reykjavik`
4. Open the [`functions.php`](https://github.com/webmandesign/child-theme/blob/master/child-theme/functions.php) file and change the following:  
    * `CHILD_THEME_SLUG` - change this to your child theme's folder name, [replacing all `-` with `_`](http://php.net/manual/en/functions.user-defined.php).  
      **Example:** if you've set your child theme folder name to `my-website-theme`, use `my_website_theme` here.
5. Optional: You can modify your child theme screenshot image too, a sample source SVG is also provided.
6. Now upload your modified child theme via FTP to `YOUR_WORDPRESS_INSTALLATION_FOLDER/wp-content/themes/` folder.  
  (Or ZIP your child theme and upload it via WordPress dashboard).
8. In your WordPress dashboard navigate to **Appearance &raquo; Themes** and activate your child theme.

You can then put any custom CSS code into the end of `style.css` file and any custom PHP code into the end of `functions.php` file.

If you need to override a whole parent theme file, just copy it into your child theme, keeping the sub-folders structure, and edit the file there. However, **in most cases this is not required** as [WebMan Design WordPress themes](https://www.webmandesign.eu/) provide a lot of action and filter hooks so you don't have to override any file as whole! Overriding whole files makes it difficult to maintain your child theme as you will need to keep up with your parent theme file updates too! For tips on these, please ask at [WebMan Design support forums](http://support.webmandesign.eu/).
